#+TITLE: atp - Automating Triton + Packer
#+LATEX: \pagebreak

* Overview

  ~atp~ generates packer configuration files and scripts to simplify
  interactions with Triton.

* Usage
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    command/atp <script | config>
  #+END_SRC

* Commands

** atp script

   Writes a script for launching packer to STDOUT. The resulting script skips
   discovery by embedding all discovered configuration values.

** make script.sh

   Same as ~atp script~, but also writes to =script.sh=.

** atp config

   Writes a packer configuration to STDOUT. This is intended to be used with the
   launch script generated by ~atp script~, but does not depend on it. See
   =Configuration= for a list of environment variables that can be used with
   this configuration.

** make config.json

   Same as ~atp config~, but writes to =config.json=.

** make run

   Creates =script.sh= and =config.json=, then passes =config.json= as an
   argument to =script.sh=.

* Provisioning Scripts

  Any scripts placed in =provisioners/shell/scripts= will be discovered
  automatically.

* Configuration

  ~atp~ is configured through environment. The following keys are available for
  customization. If a default value is listed as =discovered=, that value can
  (usually) be discovered automatically. This assumes you have the Triton CLI
  installed and correctly configured.

  | Key                       | Default Value | Description                                                          |
  |---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | IMAGE_NAME                | packer.out    | Name of output image.                                                |
  | IMAGE_VERSION             | 0.0.0         | Version of output image.                                             |
  |---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | SOURCE_MACHINE_IMAGE_NAME | opensuse-leap | *name* of source machine image. This will be used to find the UUID.  |
  |---------------------------+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | SOURCE_MACHINE_IMAGE      | =discovered=  | UUID of source machine image.                                        |
  | SOURCE_MACHINE_PACKAGE    | =discovered=  | Package used for deploying image.                                    |
  | SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE      | =discovered=  | Path to SSH key file, Packer will use this for SSH authentication.   |
  | SSH_USERNAME              | root          | SSH username for image. Packer will use this for SSH authentication. |
  | TRITON_ACCOUNT            | =discovered=  | Account name for use with Triton CloudAPI.                           |
  | TRITON_KEY_ID             | =discovered=  | SSH key fingerprint for use with Triton CloudAPI.                    |
  | TRITON_URL                | =discovered=  | URL of Triton CloudAPI.                                              |

** Persistent Configuration

   If =config/environment= exists, it will be sourced at runtime. This can be
   used to define persistent configurations.

* Dependencies

  ~atp~ relies on several external tools. For tools marked =standard=, the
  *system* =PATH= will be used (any user-defined =PATH= will be ignored). This
  is noted here because it deviates from common practice. If one or more of
  these tools is *not* found, this is a bug in your Operating System and should
  be reported as such.

  Tools marked =user= are either non-standard, or ~atp~ relies on
  implementation-specific behaviour. The user-defined =PATH= will be used to
  find these tools.

  Custom paths can be provided for any tool by setting the corresponding
  key in the environment.
